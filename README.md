Morpheus HTML4 theme for **HamsterCMS** adapted for old browsers

To use a template, create a **morpheus** folder in the **templates** folder, put all files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
